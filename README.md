# Selenium
Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers. It is primarily used for testing web applications but can also automate repetitive web-based tasks. Selenium offers several components:

Selenium WebDriver: Ideal for creating robust browser-based regression automation suites and tests.

Selenium IDE: A browser extension for quick bug reproduction scripts and exploratory testing.

Selenium Grid: Allows scaling by distributing tests across multiple machines and environments.
